Technical Report Project: User Analysis Report

Audience

•	Public school administrators
•	Parents of children enrolled in speech services
•	Teachers

Background

 	The proposal would be submitted to public school administrators, individuals who often have authority to make decisions regarding school initiatives and projects and are responsible for the dissemination of information in school districts. Public school administrators hold positions as principals, superintendents, and as members on a school district’s Board of Trustees. Principals and superintendents both have earned master’s degrees, received teaching certifications and licenses, and have experience teaching in the classroom. Typically, members on the Board of Trustees have experience serving as officers for the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or as public education advocates. 

These individuals all have an interest in public education and the policies implemented on some level. Because public school administrators represent a group of people who have the potential to facilitate change, they are the most appropriate target audience. Additional audiences may include a) teachers to ensure that they remain well-informed and b) parents of children enrolled in speech services in public schools, as the proposal would affect them as well. The public school administrators with experience in education and teaching are the most likely to understand the issue at hand as it relates to a branch of special education services. 

Identified Need

	This proposal is relevant to public school administrators because they are an audience who can revise policy. Because the lack of speech therapy during the summer can result in the decline of academic achievement, standards, and progress, public school administrators may feel obligated to take action. Upholding a positive reputation and maintaining accreditation are considered high priorities by many school districts.

Variability
	
	The established audience domain consists of public school administrators, teachers, speech-language pathologists, and parents with children enrolled in special education services and speech therapy. Use cases that may fall outside of the established audience domain may include the parents of children who do not receive special education services. 

Barriers to Delivery

	A potential barrier to understanding the message may be if the user/reader does not possess any baseline knowledge of special education services or their general purpose. An individual who is not aware of the value that speech therapy, literacy, and quality education provide to a child is not likely to recognize the significance of the topic addressed in the proposal.  There is the small likelihood that a school administrator may not be very familiar with speech-language pathology and its role in the special education department. Speech-language pathologists could potentially bridge the gap and offer more clarity to school administrators.
